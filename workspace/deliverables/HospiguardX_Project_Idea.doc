\pard\qc\f0\fs32\b MediguardX: AI Compliance Copilot for Indian Healthcare\par
\pard\qc\fs24\b0 Inspired by AuditGuardX's automation-first approach to enterprise compliance\par
\pard\fs22\par
\b 1. Problem Context\b0\par
India's healthcare ecosystem (hospitals, day-care clinics, diagnostic labs, med-tech distributors) operates under overlapping regulations: Clinical Establishments Act, Drugs & Cosmetics Act, Medical Device Rules 2017, Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, IRDAI/insurer empanelment norms, NABH/NABL accreditation standards, and the upcoming Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act. Compliance is fragmented across paper files, spreadsheets, and siloed hospital information systems, leading to expiring licenses, inconsistent SOPs, and inspection surprises. According to MoHFW audits, documentation lapses and biomedical waste violations drive a large share of penalties and temporary closures.\par
\par
\b 2. Vision\b0\par
MediguardX delivers a unified, AI-driven compliance layer tailored to Indian healthcare providers. By ingesting SOPs, consent forms, machine maintenance logs, clinician credentials, and IoT data (cold-chain, ICU equipment), the platform builds a "living compliance twin" for every facility. It continuously maps evidence against statutory checklists (drawn from \i compliance-india-healthcare.md\i0 baseline research), flags gaps with citations, and coaches teams via conversational interfaces in English and major Indian languages. Goal: reduce audit preparation time by 80% and cut regulatory penalties across hospitals, clinics, and medical device operators.\par
\par
\b 3. Core Modules\b0\par
\pard\li720\bullet\tab \b Smart Document Intelligence\b0: OCR + LLM parsing of FSSAI pharmacy licenses, CDSCO approvals, NABH manuals, fire NOCs, biomedical waste manifests. Maps clauses to regulatory obligations (Clinical Establishments Act, Medical Device Rules, DPDP Act) with confidence scoring, inspired by AuditGuardX's multi-framework analyzer.\par
\bullet\tab \b Facility Compliance Graph\b0: Normalized data model for wards, OTs, labs, pharmacies, CSSD, and waste zones. Tracks equipment calibration, AMC schedules, staff credentials, infection-control rounds, and expiry alerts.\par
\bullet\tab \b Conversational Compliance Coach\b0: Raindrop/RAG stack that answers queries like "What do we need for NABH anesthesia standards?" with step-by-step actions and links to SOPs or evidence from the locker.\par
\bullet\tab \b Evidence Locker & Workflow\b0: Mobile + web capture for geo-tagged photos/videos, IoT feeds (temperature, differential pressure), clinician sign-offs, CAPA tasks, and auditor-ready binders.\par
\bullet\tab \b Alerting & Escalation\b0: Integrations with WhatsApp/Teams/SMS to notify when licenses (CDSCO, PCB consents, CLAA blood bank approvals) near expiry, biomedical waste pickups fail, or DPDP breach reporting windows open.\par
\pard\par
\b 4. Regulatory Coverage Roadmap\b0\par
\pard\li720\bullet\tab \b Clinical Establishments Act + State Variants\b0: Registration status, display of rates, minimum standards; state-specific rules (Kerala, Karnataka, Delhi).\par
\bullet\tab \b Drugs, Devices & Trials\b0: Drugs & Cosmetics Act, Medical Device Rules 2017, New Drugs & Clinical Trials Rules 2019; production/import licenses, adverse event logs.\par
\bullet\tab \b Patient Data & Cybersecurity\b0: IT Act + SPDI, DPDP Act obligations, CERT-In 6-hour reporting, audit trails for EHR/HIS access.\par
\bullet\tab \b Biomedical Waste & Environment\b0: BMW Rules 2016, SPCB/PCB consents, manifest tracking, effluent treatment logs.\par
\bullet\tab \b Pricing & Insurance\b0: NPPA device/drug price caps, IRDAI guidelines for hospital empanelment, Ayushman Bharat packages, insurer audits.\par
\bullet\tab \b Accreditation & Quality\b0: NABH/NABL standards, blood bank regulations, infection control protocols, telemedicine guidelines.\par
\pard\par
\b 5. User Journey\b0\par
\pard\li720\bullet\tab \b Onboarding\b0: Upload existing compliance docs (licenses, SOPs, calibration certificates) and map facility zones via guided wizard referencing the research file's domain breakdown.\par
\bullet\tab \b Baseline Assessment\b0: AI evaluates readiness across clinical establishment, patient data, biomedical waste, labor, and telemedicine pillars; outputs red/yellow/green indicators tied to specific statutes.\par
\bullet\tab \b Live Operations\b0: Automated evidence ingestion from HIS/LIS/BMS/IoT, scheduled digital checklists for nursing/housekeeping/infection control, multilingual prompts for frontline teams.\par
\bullet\tab \b Audit Mode\b0: One-click generation of inspection packets for CDSCO, NABH, SPCB, or insurer empanelment with timestamped logs, photos, CAPA closures, and DPDP consent trails.\par
\pard\par
\b 6. Differentiators vs. Generic GRC Tools\b0\par
\pard\li720\bullet\tab India-specific regulatory library curated from the \i compliance-india-healthcare.md\i0 tracker, including upcoming DPDP guidance and state circulars.\par
\bullet\tab Healthcare ontology (wards, devices, biomeds) enabling contextual alerts (e.g., "MRI annual QA overdue" instead of abstract control IDs).\par
\bullet\tab Multilingual voice/chat support for nursing, housekeeping, biomedical waste teams, reducing training overhead.\par
\bullet\tab Offline-ready mobile capture for outreach clinics and ambulance units.\par
\pard\par
\b 7. Technical Architecture (High-Level)\b0\par
