# Compliance in the Indian Healthcare Industry

_Last updated: 2026-02-12_

## 1. Regulatory Landscape (Baseline)
- **MoHFW** — overarching health policy, Ayushman Bharat implementation, national health programmes.
- **National Medical Commission (NMC)** — professional standards, ethics, licensing of practitioners.
- **Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO)** — approvals for drugs/medical devices, quality surveillance, pharmacovigilance.
- **National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH)** — voluntary but influential accreditation for hospitals/clinics.
- **State Health Departments / Local Authorities** — clinical establishment licensing, inspections, biomedical waste oversight.

## 2. Core Compliance Domains & Statutes
| Domain | Statutes / Rules | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clinical establishment licensing | Clinical Establishments (Registration & Regulation) Act, 2010 + state variants | Registration, minimum standards, display of rates, record-keeping, inspections. |
| Drugs & medical devices | Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940; Medical Device Rules, 2017 | Manufacturing/import licensing, quality controls, device classification, adverse event reporting. |
| Patient data & privacy | IT Act 2000 + SPDI Rules; Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 (upcoming) | Sensitive health data handling, consent, breach notification (DPDP to formalize). |
| Clinical trials & research | New Drugs & Clinical Trials Rules, 2019; ICMR guidelines | Ethics committee approvals, compensation framework, safety reporting. |
| Pricing & insurance | NPPA price caps; IRDAI regulations | Compliance with ceiling prices for essential drugs/devices; insurer/TPA onboarding requirements. |
| Biomedical waste & environment | Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016; Environment Protection Act | Segregation, transport, treatment, disposal records, SPCB permissions. |
| Labor & workplace | Shops & Establishments Acts, labor codes, ESI, PF | Standard employment compliance, new labor code consolidation (wages, social security). |
| Telemedicine & digital health | Telemedicine Practice Guidelines 2020; ABDM/NDHM policies | Consent, documentation, e-prescriptions, Health ID integration, platform responsibilities. |
| Quality & patient safety | NABH, ICMR, blood bank rules | Accreditation frameworks, transfusion standards, infection control protocols. |

## 3. Emerging Focus Areas (2025 →)
- **DPDP Act enforcement**: healthcare-specific consent templates, data fiduciary obligations, breach reporting timelines.
- **Cybersecurity**: CERT-In 6-hour incident reporting, ransomware advisories targeting hospitals, mandatory log retention.
- **Medical device expansion**: CDSCO adding more devices to the notified list, domestic testing requirements.
- **Price transparency**: state directives (e.g., Maharashtra, Karnataka) for displaying procedure tariffs, standard treatment protocols.
- **Telemedicine liability / AI tools**: need for documentation of remote consultations, delineation of decision-support vs. autonomous AI, potential new NMC advisories.

## 4. TODO / Next Steps
- [ ] Gather state-level nuances (e.g., states that have adopted Clinical Establishments Act vs. their own laws).
- [ ] Capture enforcement examples (recent penalties, audits, or court cases) to illustrate risk.
- [ ] Add DPDP Act implementation timeline + compliance checklist for healthcare data fiduciaries.
- [ ] Outline accreditation requirements (NABH, NABL) and how they tie into insurer empanelment or government schemes.
- [ ] Monitor regulator portals (MoHFW, CDSCO, NPPA, DPDP board) once search/API access is configured.
